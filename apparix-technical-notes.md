# Apparish technical notes.

Directory bookmarking system. It used to be implemented in C, shipped with bash
wrapper functions and completion code. This is now legacy, and if you want it
you should go and get it from an old commit
(https://github.com/micans/bash-utils/tree/b825f656bc1092613d74d30ce5a1efc644d37948).

The new pure shell implementation is in `.bourne-apparish`. This works with bash
and zsh, providing tab completion for both. The zsh version goes through the
native zsh completion mechanism for files, so it will complete exactly like you
expect it to.

The bash version implements its own file completions. It has an extra
sophisticated mode called GÃ¶del completion, which quotes directories and can
still complete on subdirectories. To disable this mode, set the variable
`$APPARIX_USE_OLD_COMPLETION` to a nonempty string.

There may be some weird behaviour if you have file names with colons in. This is
because of `$COMP_WORDBREAKS`: see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2805412/bash-completion-for-maven-escapes-colon.
You may have to manually override this variable. If you do, check that it
doesn't get re-overriden by any other scripts. (`git-completion` seems to
forcefully add a colon, for example.)
