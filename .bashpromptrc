# file that sets up my flashy bashy prompt
# This file was taken from
# https://github.com/goedel-gang/dotfiles/commit/7db604534dc08672d5a6a4a5ca42968ee9398dbc
# and has had some bits lopped off to make it more stand-alone. See the original
# for a vi-mode indicator and Git information in the prompt.
# This one is mostly to provide a prompt with some colours, basic information
# and an apparix component.

# here follow a set of functions I have defined to compartmentalise my prompt a
# little. They make heavy use of ANSI terminal codes and \[ \], which are used
# to make colours/other styling like bolding, and indicate to Bash that they are
# non-printing, respectively.
# I have hardcoded all the ANSI escape codes for performance reasons - it seems
# to offer a speedup of over 50%, which is worthwile. The tput command used to
# obtain the sequence is also provided as a comment.
# Vim tput hardcoding macro (acts on next match of $(tput[^)]*)
# :let @q = "/\\$(tput[^)]*)\<CR>ft\"ayi(cgn\<C-r>\<C-r>=system(\"\<C-r>a\")\<CR>\<Esc>"
# initialise using 0fly$:<C-r><C-r>"<CR>
# fix escape sequences with :%s/<C-v>x1b/\\e/g (you have to type the proper
# sequences yourself)

# The two remaining targets for optimisation are probably reducing function
# overhead (that is, making the whole thing one disgusting, illegible,
# unmodifiable one-liner) and the apparix_prompt function, which takes a fair
# amount of time. See prompt_profile() later on.

# function which returns a code to make text green if exit status was
# successful, and red otherwise. Indicates the value of a non-zero return
# status. TAKES AN ARGUMENT
