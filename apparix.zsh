# FIGMENTIZE: zapparix

# Thin wrapper around Zsh's directory hashing, to provide an Apparix-like
# persistent bookmarking system.

# This script does frequently source $ZAPPARIXRC. If you think this will be a
# problem (eg for some reason a malicious agent has access to your $ZAPPARIXRC)
# you probably shouldn't use it.

# All you need to do is ensure that this script has been sourced, and then call
# `bm <mark>` when you're in a directory that you wish to assign the bookmark
# <mark> to. From then on, you can use ~<mark> anywhere where Zsh is doing
# filename expansion (which is everywhere), so for example you can cd, mv, vim,
# cat, you name it.

# Because it wraps hash, any bookmark must conform to hash's standards, so no
# messing around with spaces and equals signs. Also, any bookmark with prefix
# _GOEDEL_TEST is reserved for use within this script. (They're not very quick
# to type, anyway).

# Naturally, this integrates straight into Zsh's completion system, you can
# complete on hashed directories and any contained files or subdirectories, with
# all of your completion configuration just as you've set it.

# Another plus is that the Zsh prompt expansion %~ understands hashed
# directories, so most likely your prompt let you know when you're in one.

# If you're creating bookmarks across different running Zsh sessions, they
# shouldn't clobber one another but they won't update until you run `bm`, with
# or without arguments.

# Also provided is an unbm function, which removes a bookmark with a name. Both
# bm and unbm should provide feedback when you add or delete bookmarks.

# Be warned, this script quite bluntly clears and repopulates the list of
# directory hashes, so if you were using it for something else, either do this
# through zapparix or think of another solution.

# I know that many of these double quotes are probably redundant, but I've been
# writing a lot of Bash and don't have the mental capacity to keep two things
# separate. I might change it sometime, or if whoever is reading this really
# desperately cares, go wild!
